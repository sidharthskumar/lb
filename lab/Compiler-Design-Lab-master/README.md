# Compiler-Design-Lab
All the work done during my Compiler Design Lab course for my B.Tech 

1.E_Closure_NFA  <br />
&nbsp;  Program to find epsilon closure of all states of an NFA.  <br />
2.Epsilon-NFA-To-NFA  <br />
&nbsp;  Program to convert Epsilon NFA to NFA without epsilon states  <br />
3.LexicalAnalyser <br />
&nbsp;  Program to get tokens of all type in a piece of C code.<br />
4.NFA_TO_DFA <br />
&nbsp;This program takes an NFA as an input described in a file. Output will be the corresponding DFA. Output is written to a text &nbsp;file. The input must be described in the specific format for the program to work. <br />
5.Lex Tool<br />
&nbsp;  Define all the rules and parse the input program. I have implemented a simple lexical analyser.<br />

6.Recursive Descent parser<br />
&nbsp;  Parses a given arithmetic expression and prints the result. Expression given in the source code.<br />
